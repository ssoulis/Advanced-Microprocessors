# Advanced-Microprocessors

My projects in Laboratory Of Advanced Microprocessors

INTRODUCTION:

AVR is a family of microprocessors originally developed by Atmel and
later purchased by Microchip Technology. It is based on a modified Harvard
architecture, 8-bit RISC single-chip microprocessor. AVR is one of the first families
of microprocessors that used on-chip flash memory, to store programs, in
unlike a programmable ROM, EPROM or EEPROM used by others
microcontrollers.Microprocessors of this family are used in many
applications, as complete integrated systems. They are utilized as educational embedded
layouts and became famous due to their widespread use, in many open hardware developments
boards, of the Arduino series.
Microchip Studio (or Atmel® Studio 7) is a comprehensive development platform
(Integrated Development Platform - IDP), for creating applications with AVR and SAM
microcontrollers (MCUs). The platform offers an easy-to-use environment for writing,
build and debug applications written in C/C++ and/or se
Assembly. It is also possible to import projects to Arduino as C/C++ projects and
500+ AVR and SAM devices are supported. Finally, Microchip Studio includes a huge
source code library with 1600+ example applications. For more information
visit the Microchip page, which lists all the features in detail
of Studio.


PURPOSE OF PROJECT:

Learn how to effectively program Advanced Microprocessors.

VERSION or DATE: SPRING 2021

The project report and the comments in my code were originally written by me in Greek and were translated by me so there may be some mistakes in the traslated 
version (grammar) :)

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

You can easily run my codes using Microchip Studio (or Atmel® Studio 7), you can also run them with any C,C++ IDE but Atmel is reccomended so you 
can debug and see the results live.


Thank you for your time!
